\section{Required Second-phase Revisions}


\begin{editorial}
After lengthy discussions the reviewers have decided to accept this paper to phase 2. It is imperative that the authors integrate all clarifications made in the rebuttal, and in particular/in addition focus on the following points:

1. As promised in the response, add breakdowns of performance measurements wrt the mentioned sources of improvements
\end{editorial}

\begin{answer}

We addressed the above comment fully, integrating extended material that was summarized in our
response:

\begin{itemize}
\item The revised benchmark section contains full breakdowns of performance measurements, especially
quantifying memory effects. The benchmarks discussion is now much more detailed.

\item We added examples of transformation description objects in section 2.2 (partial) and in an Appendix.
\item We clarified ``the sequence of transformations that lead to stack allocation'' (end of 2.1).
\item We clarified the motivation for the scoped nature of the transformation in section 2.2.
\item We discuss dynamically loaded code (4.5, heading ``Dynamic and native code''), static analysis
  (clarification added to end of 4.1), cascading scopes (4.2, heading ``handling nested transformation description objects'').
\item We added clarifications (``suffixes to distinguish the 'gcd' methods) in section 2.3.
\end{itemize}

\end{answer}

\begin{editorial-addr}
2. Tone down the claims regarding the generality of the approach, as it is yet unclear whether/how it applies beyond Scala
\end{editorial-addr}

\begin{answer}
We went over the paper to ensure that we do not claim applicability beyond Scala. In the Introduction section we changed occurrences of ``general'' (pertaining to the flexibility of the transformation) to ``as the programmer sees fit''. In the Conclusions we added an explicit sentence: ``We demonstrated our mechanism in the Scala language, yet speculate that the same principles can be applicable in different language settings.'' This is the strongest generality claim we make in the revised paper, yet we believe it is reasonable to be speculative in a Conclusions section.
\end{answer}


%What follows is a set of responses to each of the reviewers' comments and requests.

%Once again, we are grateful to the reviewers for the work they put into the reviews and their very useful feedback! We apologize in advance for the feedback that we did not have time or did not know how to address, but, nevertheless, we have done our best to improve the paper.


\section{Feedback Request: Title Change}

We would like to take a moment to ask our reviewers  their opinion:

We are considering using the name ``Data-centric Meta-programming'' for our technique. It captures the programmer-driven and compile-time aspects of our work while keeping the focus on data: data representation and operations on data. We have used this title in two presentations (\href{https://speakerdeck.com/vladureche/data-centric-metaprogramming-at-icooolps-2015}{ICOOOLPS} and \href{https://speakerdeck.com/vladureche/data-centric-metaprogramming-at-ecocloud-2015}{EcoCloud}) with very good feedback.

If the reviewers have any feedback on the possible title change, it would be highly welcome. We are at the point of making this decision. The change would require adapting the paper content to replace references to ``Ad hoc Data Representation Transformations'' by ``Data-centric Meta-programming''.

\section{Other Edits (non-required): Individual Reviews}

\subsection{First Review}

\subsubsection{Paper Summary}

This paper describes how programmers specify more space efficient data layout in a statically typed language at a variety of scopes (methods, code blocks, etc.) and then the compiler type checks it and inserts the code that automatically transforms between the high and low level representations as needed based on user annotations.  This approach is analogous to the compiler boxing and unboxing with some user annotations, but the programmer has to do more here. The approach speeds up some Scala microbenchmarks.

This work has the potential to be very interesting, but this paper is not yet ready to accepted, because of presentations choices and lack of analysis of where the benefits come from and discussion of programmer work.

The paragraph starting with "In this way.." in the introduction uses the passive voice (a problem elsewhere as well), and so it very difficult to tell what the programmer does, what the compiler does, and what the runtime does.

Section 2.1 lacks any description of what the approach actually does to the code or allocation, and thus why the code improves.

\begin{reviewer-addr}
Section 4.1 elides all the details, but that is the actual work the developer needs to do to define make this approach work.
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
We have added brief passages on how the transformation description objects should be defined in Sections 2.2 and 4.1. There are two reasons we refrain from giving a recipe: 1. Each set of transformations is ultimately tailored for the exact program it is meant for and 2. The target audience, namely the research community, would benefit less from this information. Instead, we show complete transformations with tips and tricks in the online project documentation (\url{https://github.com/miniboxing/ildl-plugin/wiki}), which is the entry point for the programmers.

\begin{reviewer}
The methodology is not described. Measuring JIT code and GC has a number of challenges and it is not sufficient to point the reader to the Scala web page to find out about the performance analysis methodology. Since the approach is saving GC and/or allocation, that actually should be measured and reported.

The paper spends a lot of pages (~4) describing LDL, which can easily be summarized in a page.

\begin{answer}
If there is consensus among reviewers that Section 3 should be shortened we will do so. The single reason we chose to slowly build up the explanation was to allow our readers to understand the main idea without forcing them to branch off and read the LDL paper.

\subsection{Second Review}

\subsubsection{Paper Summary}

The paper opens and extends the Late Data Layout mechanism developed for the Scala compiler (to automatically and autonomously choose between different data representations, such as values or heap objects) for the programmer, who can use it to create and use her own (low-level) data representations in specified scopes.

\subsubsection{Comments For Author}

\begin{reviewer-addr}
A very well-written paper. Even though the scope and utility of the presented work are somewhat limited, it nevertheless makes a solid contribution to (object-oriented) programming, with applications mainly in performance-critical contexts (in which ADRTs likely lead to cleaner code than its ad-hoc tuning alternatives).
\vspace{5mm}

The paper is carefully set in the context of related work, the presented evaluation is sufficient to convince me of the practical relevance and utility. Overall, very well done!
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
Thank you for the very positive review!
\end{answer}

\subsection{Third Review}

\subsubsection{Paper Summary}

This paper presents a technique to automatically change data representation for efficient access. To use the technique, users first delimits the scope for which transformation should be considered. In addition, users also provide the compiler (in this case the Scala compiler) with a descriptor object the encodes how each of the data types can be transformed. Given these inputs, the compiler then searches through the delimited scope and performs a source-to-source transformation in choosing the most efficient representation for each data type. The paper shows that the technique can handle interactions with other Java language features, and can improve performance in a variety of benchmarks.



\subsubsection{Comments For Author}

The paper discusses an important problem (data layout) and proposes an interesting semi-automated solution. It is a well-structured paper.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

My main concern, however, is with the novelty of the solution to the problem, especially given the prior work on late data representation, which makes up the bulk of the implementation of the presented technique:

\begin{reviewer-addr}
\begin{packed_item}
\item I am wondering why do users need to delimit the scope for which the transformation should be applied. Why not apply to the entire program? Is it a scalability issue?
\end{packed_item}
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
Different transformations are suitable for different contexts, all within a single program. The scoped nature of the ADRT transformation is not a limitation, but actually part of its design. We have clarified this in Sections 2.2 and 4.6.
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer}
\begin{packed_item}
\item How easy is it to write the transformation objects? While some
seem trivial to write (e.g., the motivating example), I imagine some of them
mentioned in the benchmarks can be quite involved. It would be great if the
authors can show how big those transformers are, and also discuss how can
developers come up with such representations.
\end{packed_item}
\end{reviewer}

\begin{answer}
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer}
\begin{packed_item}
\item Would the same technique be applicable beyond Scala? For instance
I would like to understand whether the proposed technique can be achieved
using tagged unions in languages that support them. I can imagine a smart
compiler choosing how to implement each instance of the tagged union using
static analysis, and inserting appropriate coercions as needed. In that sense
it seems to be similar to the technique proposed in the paper.

\newpage

\subsection{Forth Review}

\subsubsection{Paper Summary}

The paper proposes a mechanism which allows programmers to 1) define operations which
implicitly transform between two different representations of a type, and 2) the compiler
applies these operations implicitly, whenever necessary within a given scope. The approach
is based on Scala’s Late Data Layout transformations, with the difference that the former
is not programmer-driven, and cannot be restricted to separate scopes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The paper explains the tree phases involved in Late Data Layout Transformation (LDRT) and
how they are applied in  Ad Hoc Data Representation Transformation (ADRT). It explains how
ADRT interacts with traits. Overloading, generics, and separate compilation. It also introduces
the concept of “bypass” transformations, which allows to avoid unnecessary intermediate
transformations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to validate the approach, the authors developed some micro-benchmarks (gcd on
Complex numbers), least squares method, Sensor readings  (filtering and visualization of
Sensor readings), and Hamming numbers. In these cases they observed speedups between
2 and 13 times. They also considered the Scala-streams library and benchmarks
proposed in [13], and the framian vector implementation from a commercial entity, and
observe speedups of about 10 times.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Points in Favor}

\begin{reviewer}
\begin{packed_item}
\item Clearly stated problem, and clear solution
\item The paper is extremely well-written with a small motivating example, and very clear organization.
Questions are asked which motivate the discussion further, and pointers are given to where
the answer will appear.
\item Implementation has been developed, and the benchmarks are positive

\end{reviewer}

\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Points Against}

\begin{reviewer}
\begin{packed_item}
\item The semantics of the ADRT is described incrementally and in terms of three phases. Various
Extra aspects of the phases are uncovered as we progress through the paper. Is it possible
to give a more declarative semantics? If not, I would propose that in the next version of
your paper, you give the definition of each phase in one go.
\end{packed_item}
\end{reviewer}

\begin{answer}
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer}
\begin{packed_item}
\item Even though the benchmark results are very encouraging, I wonder how often one has
the opportunity for such data representations. The benchmarks you have chosen either
allocated large numbers of short lived intermediate objects, or have large containers of
objects; thus you could think that they were specifically chosen for this work, and that
they would not be representative of many real situations.
\end{packed_item}
\end{reviewer}

\begin{answer}
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Questions}

\begin{reviewer-addr}
1)  I suppose that the “gcd” method called in the first box in page 1 is different from
the “gcd” method called in the first box in page 2.
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
We have added a suffix which distinguishes the different \verb=gcd= methods in Section 2.
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer-addr}
2)  When I first read section 2.3, I thought that by some magic the correct implementation
of gcd would be created. But when I reached the end of section 4, I came to the
conclusion that this is not done. So, I suppose that the gcd created within the adrt
will bind the wrong version of \%? And that there will be an error message because
there will be no appropriate method called norm?
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
We have added a statement at the end of Section 2.3 that clarifies the fact that the naive transformation is incorrect and the ADR transformation is more involved. Indeed, if we were to implement this transformation by hand, one of the first errors we would encounter is that long integers do not have a \verb=norm= method.
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer-addr}
Also, you refer to section 4.4 for semantics preservation, but I do not see the relation between that section and
semantics preservation; did you mean 4.1?
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
Thank you! We updated the description to ``Therefore, to correctly transform the code, ADRT needs equivalent versions of the methods that operate on the long integer representation'', which should be a better description of Section 4.4.
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer-addr}
3)  Under “Target Semantics” you are enumerating several requirements from these
Transformation objects. I suppose that these requirements are not checked in any way.
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
We updated the description in Section 4.1 to clearly explain the complexity introduced by referential equality and mutability and the fact that a static analysis pass would be useful (and is not yet part of our solution).
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer}
4)  Do you support cyclic representation transformation, eg something
like
adrt(T1toT2){
   adrt(T2toT1){
    ... code ...
   }
}
where T1toT2 has T1 as the high level type, and T2 as the low level type, while T2toT1 has T2 as the high level type, and T1 as the low level type.
\end{reviewer}

\begin{answer}
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer-addr}
5)  At several points you require value types, but my I thought that the approach should also work for mutable types. Can you say why you need the types to be immutable? Also, what does immutable mean in that case, whether it is checked and how?
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
We added an explanation of why mutability and referential equality make the transformations more difficult at the Section 4.1. Furthermore, we added the following idea for future work:
``A desirable extension to our approach would be to statically check the compatibility of the high-level type with its coercions. This could prevent the programmer from incorrectly copying internally mutable objects inside the coercions.''
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Suggestions}

\begin{reviewer-addr}
Initially I was very surprised that adrt was not a keyword – I found the explanation later;
I suggest you bring the explanation forward.
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
Thank you! We moved the description of the \verb=adrt= marker at the end of Section 2.2.
\end{answer}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vspace{5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{reviewer-addr}
On page 3 I was puzzling how the system could work without some signature defining that
high level and the representation of a type were. This became clearer when I read the
Description of IntPairComplexToLongComplex on page 5. I think you should bring it forward.
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
Thank you! We moved the description of the \verb=IntPairComplexToLongComplex= object to Section 2.2.
\end{answer}

\begin{reviewer-addr}
I also suggest you give a link to  Gaussian integers, so that the reader is not puzzled about the
meaning of ``norm'' for pairs of integers.
\end{reviewer-addr}

\begin{answer}
Thank you! We cited the original paper by Carl Friedrich Gauss that introduced Gaussian Integers and the Wikipedia page describing their properties.
